## Getting Started üèÅ
- To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running npm install.
3. Create a file called .env in the root directory of the project and add your API keys for the Pexel API and Dictionary API. Your .env file should look like this:

```
PEXEL_API_KEY=your_api_key
DICTIONARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

4. Start the development server by running npm start. The app should open in your default browser.

## Known Issues ‰∑Ö
- The app may not display results for all words, as the Dictionary API only covers a limited number of words.
- The app may not display images for all words, as the Pexel API may not have relevant images for all words.
